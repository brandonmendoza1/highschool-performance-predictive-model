# Project Background
This Student Performance Prediction project analyzes academic data collected from two Portuguese secondary schools, originally published on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes student grades, demographic information, and social and school-related factors gathered via school reports and questionnaires.

The primary objective of this project is to explore which factors influence academic outcomes and to build predictive models that can help forecast student performance. This analysis has important implications for educators, policymakers, and support staff aiming to improve educational outcomes.

This project uses statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to uncover actionable insights and trends in student behavior and achievement.
## Insights and analysis were conducted across the following key areas:
- **Academic Performance Modeling:**
Use of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Regression Trees to predict final grades (G3).
- **Feature Significance:**
Identification of important factors such as study time, parental education, academic failures, internet access, and aspirations for higher education.
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**
Handling outliers, converting categorical variables, checking correlation, and applying dummy encoding.
- **Model Evaluation:**
Comparative analysis of different model performances based on RÂ² values, RMSE, and prediction accuracy.
- **Research Comparisons:**
Benchmarked against existing academic studies using similar datasets and methods.

## Data Preprocessing
A heatmap was created using the dataset in order to find correlations
